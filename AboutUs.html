<h3>Wild Thing Magazine, August 2012:</h3>
<blockquote>"If you believe the saying, you only get married once, then you will want to make your honeymoon a memorable experience.
Extreme Honeymoons can help the couple that screams together, stay together.  They will expertly plan every step of your unforgetable trip so that all you will have to do is just survive.
According to Ted Russon, the founder of Extreme Honeymoons, "What else would you want to do on your honeymoon?
Some of the wild things they could plan for you include: kayaking on the Colorado River, bungee Jumping at Flaming Gorge Dam, bareback riding in the Bryce Canyon Rodeo, and an ATV safari across the Great Western Trail."</blockquote>

<h3>Utah Brides Magazine, May 2012:</h3>
<blockquote>"Brides-to-be might worry that their honeymoon may be a forgetable experience. If you think a candle lit dinner sounds boring and you have seen one too many movies, then consider an Extreme Honeymoon.
Let Ted Russon's Extreme Honeymoons plan all the details of a wild and crazy honeymoon adventure. These reasonable priced tours are totally safe and an insurance policy is included with the cost of all packages.
One recent newlywed breathlessly related this experience,"Like, it was the most awesome experience of my life!"  So surprise your new spouse with a white-knuckle honeymoon."</blockquote>
